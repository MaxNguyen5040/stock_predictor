# stock_predictor

Wanted to get into understanding stocks and trading this summer! I thought a super cool arcade project could be making an app that not only displays data by fetching it from APIs, but also run custom machine learning models that I could train myself (and tweak parameters!) to see how accurate they could be!

Development Progress:
 - Dash app is up and running, was really cool to learn about running a local server!
 - Some machine learning models like XGBRegressor and LGBMRegressor are working, in a very basic way. 

Future Steps:
 - My next step will be combining this with Flask to create a better interface, and defintely test with more models!
